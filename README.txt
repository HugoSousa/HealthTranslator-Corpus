These annotations are the result of the agreement of the professionals and laypeople group (2 phases).

Although the final agreement annotations have been pre-processed, the annotations in the professionals and laypeople group were not:
- the length and the word of some Automatic-Concept tags do not coincide and need to be fixed. This happens because the concept is in singular but the length represents the concept in the plural and thus needs to be changed.
- the Automatic-Concept and Medical_Concept should be merged into a single tag.
- latin characters need to be replaced, as they represented by their unicode. For example, "u00E9" should be replaced by "é".
